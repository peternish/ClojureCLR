## 1 Deprecated and Removed Features

### 1.1 Clojure 1.5 reducers library requires Java 6 or later

The new reducers library (see below) requires Java 6 plus a ForkJoin
library, or Java 7 or later.  Clojure 1.5 can still be compiled and
run with Java 5.  The only limitations with Java 5 are that the new
reducers library will not work, and building Clojure requires skipping
the test suite (e.g. by using the command "ant jar").


## 2 New and Improved Features

### 2.1 Reducers

Reducers provide a set of high performance functions for working with collections. The actual fold/reduce algorithms are specified via the collection being reduced. This allows each collection to define the most efficient way to reduce its contents.

The implementation details of reducers are available at the  [Clojure blog](http://clojure.com/blog/2012/05/08/reducers-a-library-and-model-for-collection-processing.html) and therefore won't be repeated in these change notes. However, as a summary:

* There is a new namespace: clojure.core.reducers
* It contains new versions of map, filter etc based upon transforming reducing functions - reducers
* It contains a new function, fold, which is a parallel reduce+combine
fold uses fork/join when working with (the existing!) Clojure vectors and maps
* Your new parallel code has exactly the same shape as your existing seq-based code
* The reducers are composable
* Reducer implementations are primarily functional - no iterators
* The model uses regular data structures, not 'parallel collections' or other OO malarkey
* It's fast, and can become faster still
* This is work-in-progress

Examples:

	user=> (require '[clojure.core.reducers :as r])
	user=> (reduce + (r/filter even? (r/map inc [1 1 1 2])))
	;=> 6


	;;red is a reducer awaiting a collection
	user=> (def red (comp (r/filter even?) (r/map inc)))
	user=> (reduce + (red [1 1 1 2]))
	;=> 6

	user=> (into #{} (r/filter even? (r/map inc [1 1 1 2])))
	;=> #{2}

### 2.2 Reader Literals improved

* [CLJ-1034](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1034)
  "Conflicting data-reader mapping" should no longer be thrown where there really isn't a conflict. Until this patch, having data_readers.clj on the classpath twice would cause the above exception.

* [CLJ-927](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-927)
  Added `*default-data-reader-fn*` to clojure.core. When no data reader is found for a tag and `*default-data-reader-fn*`is non-nil, it will be called with two arguments, the tag and the value.  If `*default-data-reader-fn*` is nil (the default), an exception will be thrown for the unknown tag.

### 2.3 clojure.core/set-agent-send-executor!, set-agent-send-off-executor!, and send-via

Added two new functions:

* clojure.core/set-agent-send-executor!

  Allows the user to set the `java.util.concurrent.Executor` used when calling `clojure.core/send`. Defaults to a fixed thread pool of size: (numCores + 2)

* clojure.core/set-agent-send-off-executor!

 	Allows the user to set the `java.util.concurrent.Executor` used when calling `clojure.core/send-off`. Defaults to a cached thread pool.

* clojure.core/send-via

	Like `send`, and `send-off`, except the first argument to this function is an executor to use when sending.




### 2.4 New threading macros

* clojure.core/cond-> [expr & clauses]

	Takes an expression and a set of test/form pairs. Threads the expression (via ->) through each form for which the corresponding test expression (not threaded) is true.

Example:

	user=> (cond-> 1
				   true inc
	               false (* 42)
	               (= 2 2) (* 3))
	6

* clojure.core/cond->> [expr & clauses]

	Takes an expression and a set of test/form pairs. Threads expr (via ->>)
  through each form for which the corresponding test expression (not threaded) is true.

Example:

	user=> (def d [0 1 2 3])
	#'user/d
	user=> (cond->> d
				    true (map inc)
					(seq? d) (map dec)
					(= (count d) 4) (reduce +)) ;; no threading in the test expr
					                            ;; so d must be passed in explicitly
	10


* clojure.core/as-> [expr name & forms]

Binds name to expr, evaluates the first form in the lexical context of that binding, then binds name to that result, repeating for each successive form

Note: this form does not actually perform any threading. Instead it allows the user to assign a name and lexical context to a value created by a parent threading form.

Example:

	user=> (-> 84
	    	   (/ 4)
	    	   (as-> twenty-one          ;; uses the value from ->
	           		  (* 2 twenty-one)))  ;; no threading here
	42

* clojure.core/some-> [expr & forms]


When expr is not nil, threads it into the first form (via ->),
 and when that result is not nil, through the next etc.

Example:

	user=> (defn die [x] (assert false))
	#'user/die
	user=> (-> 1 inc range next next next die)
	AssertionError Assert failed: false  user/die (NO_SOURCE_FILE:65)
	user=> (some-> 1 inc range next next next die)
	nil



* clojure.core/some->> [expr & forms]

  When expr is not nil, threads it into the first form (via ->>),
  and when that result is not nil, through the next etc.

  Same as some-> except the value is threaded as the last argument in each form.

### 2.5 Column metadata captured by reader

* [CLJ-960](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-960)
  Data read by the clojure reader is now tagged with :column in addition to :line.


### 2.6 gen-class improvements

* [CLJ-745](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-745)
  It is now possible to expose protected final methods via `:exposes-methods` in `gen-class`. This allows Clojure classes created via gen-class to access protected methods of its parent class.

Example:

	(gen-class :name clojure.test_clojure.genclass.examples.ProtectedFinalTester
    	       :extends java.lang.ClassLoader
        	   :main false
           	   :prefix "pf-"
           	   :exposes-methods {findSystemClass superFindSystemClass})

* [CLJ-948](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-948)
  It is now possible to annotate constructors via `gen-class`.

Example:

	(gen-class :name foo.Bar
    	       :extends clojure.lang.Box
        	   :constructors {^{Deprecated true} [Object] [Object]}
           	   :init init
           	   :prefix "foo")

### 2.7 Support added for marker protocols

* [CLJ-966](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-966)
  `defprotocol` no longer requires that at least one method be given in the definition of the protocol. This allows for marker protocols, whose sole reason of existence is to allow `satisfies?` to be true for a given type.


Example:

	user=> (defprotocol P (hi [_]))
    P
    user=> (defprotocol M) ; marker protocol
    M
    user=> (deftype T [a] M P (hi [_] "hi there"))
    user.T
    user=> (satisfies? P (T. 1))
    true
    user=> (satisfies? M (T. 1))
    true
    user=> (hi (T. 1))
    "hi there"
    user=> (defprotocol M2 "marker for 2") ; marker protocol again
    M2
    user=> (extend-type T M2)
    nil
    user=> (satisfies? M2 (T. 1))
    true


### 2.8 clojure.pprint/print-table output compatible with Emacs Org mode

For the convenience of those that use Emacs Org mode,
`clojure.pprint/print-table` now prints tables in the form used by
that mode.  Emacs Org mode has features to make it easy to edit such
tables, and even to do spreadsheet-like calculations on their
contents.  See the [Org mode documentation on
tables](http://orgmode.org/manual/Tables.html) for details.

    user=> (clojure.pprint/print-table [:name :initial-impression]
               [{:name "Rich" :initial-impression "rock star"}
                {:name "Andy" :initial-impression "engineer"}])
    | :name | :initial-impression |
    |-------+---------------------|
    |  Rich |           rock star |
    |  Andy |            engineer |


### 2.9 clojure.string/replace and replace-first handle special characters more predictably

`clojure.string/replace` and `clojure.string/replace-first` are now
consistent in the way that they handle the replacement strings: all
characters in the replacement strings are treated literally, including
backslash and dollar sign characters.

    user=> (require '[clojure.string :as s])

    user=> (s/replace-first "munge.this" "." "$")
    ;=> "munge$this"

    user=> (s/replace "/my/home/dir" #"/" (fn [s] "\\"))
    ;=> "\\my\\home\\dir"

There is one exception, which is described in the doc strings.  If you
call these functions with a regex to search for and a string as the
replacement, then dollar sign and backslash characters in the
replacement string are treated specially.  Occurrences of `$1` in the
replacement string are replaced with the string that matched the first
parenthesized subexpression of the regex, occurrences of `$2` are
replaced with the match of the second parenthesized subexpression,
etc.

    user=> (s/replace "x12, b4" #"([a-z]+)([0-9]+)" "$1 <- $2")
    ;=> "x <- 12, b <- 4"

Individual occurrences of `$` or `\` in the replacement string that
you wish to be treated literally can be escaped by prefixing them with
a `\`.  If you wish your replacement string to be treated literally
and its contents are unknown to you at compile time (or you don't wish
to tarnish your constant string with lots of backslashes), you can use
the new function `clojure.string/re-quote-replacement` to do the
necessary escaping of special characters for you.

    user=> (s/replace "x12, b4" #"([a-z]+)([0-9]+)"
                         (s/re-quote-replacement "$1 <- $2"))
    ;=> "$1 <- $2, $1 <- $2"


### 2.10 Set and map constructor functions allow duplicates

All of the functions that construct sets such as `set` and
`sorted-set` allow duplicate elements to appear in their arguments,
and they are documented to treat this case as if by repeated uses of
`conj`.

Similarly, all map constructor functions such as `hash-map`,
`array-map`, and `sorted-map` allow duplicate keys, and are documented
to treat this case as if by repeated uses of `assoc`.

As before, literal sets, e.g. `#{1 2 3}`, do not allow duplicate
elements, and while elements can be expressions evaluated at run time
such as `#{(inc x) (dec y)}`, this leads to a check for duplicates at
run time whenever the set needs to be constructed, throwing an
exception if any duplicates are found.

Similarly, literal maps do not allow duplicate keys.  New to Clojure
1.5 is a performance optimization: if all keys are compile time
constants but one or more values are expressions requiring evaluation
at run time, duplicate keys are checked for once at compile time only,
not each time a map is constructed at run time.

* [CLJ-1065](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1065)
  Allow duplicate set elements and map keys for all set and map constructors


### 2.11 More functions preserve metadata

Most functions that take a collection and return a "modified" version
of that collection preserve the metadata that was on the input
collection, e.g. `conj`, `assoc`, `dissoc`, etc.  One notable
exception was `into`, which would return a collection with metadata
`nil` for several common types of input collections.

Now the functions `into`, `select-keys`, `clojure.set/project`, and
`clojure.set/rename` return collections with the same metadata as
their input collections.


## 3 Performance Enhancements

* [CLJ-988](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-988)
  Multimethod tables are now protected by a read/write lock instead of a synchronized method. This should result in a performance boost for multithreaded code using multimethods.
* [CLJ-1061](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1061)
  `when-first` now evaluates its expression only once.
* [CLJ-1084](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1084)
  `PersistentVector$ChunkedSeq` now implements `Counted` interface, to avoid some cases where vector elements were being counted by iterating over their elements.
* [CLJ-867](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-867)
  Records with same fields and field values, but different types, now usually hash to different values.


## 4 Improved error messages

* [CLJ-1052](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1052)
  `assoc` now throws an exception if the last key argument is missing a value.

# Changes to ClojureCLR in Version 1.5

We have made all the changes, bug fixes, etc., listed above that are relevant to ClojureCLR, 
_except_ for the change to use test.generative.  The test.generative lib is used only in the
test suite.  We plan to make that change in the future when we have a more robust build system
that facilitates pulling in clojure libs.

## 1 New and improved features

### 1.1 Clojure 1.5 reducers library dependency

The new reducers library (see above) in ClojureCLR also has a version
dependency.  In .Net 4.0 and later, the fork/join capability required
by the reducers library is implemented using System.Threading.Tasks.Task.
in .Net 3.5 and earlier, we use our own minimal implmenentation of Task named
clojure.lang.Task35 to provide the needed functionality for this use. 
This should be invisible to the user.

### 1.2 Mono

The build process has been cleaned up and enhancements made to allow builds to work using Mono.

### Primitive type hints

We now allow type hints such as ^System.Double to work the same as ^double.  This was required
in order to allow extend-protocol to extend to primitive types.  (And also to meet user expectations.)

## 2 Bug fixes specific to ClojureCLR

* Updated arr with ^objects type information so the aget function will be properly resolved
* Make re-groups.direct (clojure.string) private
* Fix RT.nth problem with infinite LazySeqs
* Fix clojure.repl proxy of PushbackTextReader problem under .Net 4.5
* Add IDisposable type hint in with-open
