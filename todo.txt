This list is most definitely incomplete.

These are in no particular order.


- Look closely at all code generation to find areas for speedup

- Add other bootstrap *.clj files (remaining are: clojure.xml and inspector.xml)

- Add more unit tests for the basic data structures.

- Test against all the clojure/contrib/test_clojure/*.clj files.

- Add gen-class.

- Add proxies. 


- Add missing array support, including
    -- figure out how to handle ragged n-dim arrays versus true multi-dim arrays.


- Add callsites for host expression calls.  See MethodBinder.
    -- As part of this, look at the type handling in selecting a target method
       based on argument types in host calls.

Far away in the distance:

- Really pay attention to doing all the proper DLR hosting work.

- Compiler unit tests.



You can look for TODO comments in the code for additional tasks.
