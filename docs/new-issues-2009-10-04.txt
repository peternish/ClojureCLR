Improve use of threads in Agent code.
   Right now, just starting our own threads and forgetting it.  We need to manage a thread pool.
   Also, shutdown not implemented.



### Verify use of methods in ArrayHelper.  Add missing methods for other primitive types.
### ArrayStream: check for rank of array > 1.
### ArrayStream: Get rid of instantiations of ArrayStreamBase.
### Get rid of NumberV0.
### Get rid of DLR hosting methods that aren't being used.
### Change alpha designation on readme page.




Compiler.GenerateAST: Get rid of extra (fn* [] form) wrapper.  Copy how the JVM version does it (if possible).

Compiler: compile lambdas to specific delegate type so we can use Invoke instead of DynamicInvoke.


Get rid of RT.T and RT.F -- they serve no purpose in CLR.

Define RT.LoadFileFn

Questions:

### Why do some implementations of withMeta check to see if the current meta equals new meta, and some do not?

### APersistentVector:
###    Why does APersistentVector+RSeq implement Counted but APersistentVector+Seq does not?
###    Why does APersistentVector+Seq implement IReduce by APersistetnVector+RSeq does not?
### 
###    What is the meaning of IndexedSeq.index on a reversed IndexedSeq?
###       Should the index return the index relative to the original sequence or relative to the reversed sequence?
###       Check out APersistentVector+RSeq. Why does it return _i instead of _length-_i-1?

### RT.stream
###   else if (coll is Fn)  // TODO: Note use of Fn to imply castable to IFn.  Should we do this? Why not just check for IFn?
###                 return new Stream((IFn)coll);
### RT stream support:  EmptyGen:  Why is the invoke synchronized?
