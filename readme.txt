ClojureCLR

This project is a native implementation of Clojure on Microsoft's .Net Framework,
programmed in C# and using the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR).

Status: Beta
        Still best for developers until we develop an installer

Goals:

 -- Implement a feature-complete Clojure on top of CLR/DLR.
 -- Stay as close as possible to the JVM implementation.
 -- Spawn a cottage industry of people making Visual Studio extensions for Clojure. :)
 -- Have some fun.
