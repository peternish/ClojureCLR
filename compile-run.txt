
Compiling
---------

Adding AOT-compilation allows pre-compilation of the *.clj environment bootstrap files.
I have not had time to automate the build process fully, so there are some manual steps.

  (1) Build the whole project.
  (2) Copy all Clojure\Boostrap\*.clj files into BootstrapCompile\bin\Debug\clojure.  
  (3) Run the BootstrapCompile program.
  (4) Copy the .dll and .pdb files from BootstrapCompile\bin\Debug\clojure 
      to Simple.Console\bin\Debug\clojure and Clojure.Main\bin\Debug\clojure.

Then you should be good to go.


Running
-------

Clojure.Main is set as the startup project in Visual Studio.  This will load the Clojure environment,
including main.clj, and then run the main repl loop.  Essentially this is equivalent to the ClojureJVM:

    java -cp clojure.jar clojure.main


Simple.Console is useful for developers when you have been breaking things and don't want to rely on main.clj working.
At minimum, you need core.clj.dll or core.clj and core_print.clj.dll or core_print.clj in the clojure subdirectory 
below the executable.

There being no direct equivalent to CLASSPATH, you can instead set the environment variable clojure.load.path to 
the a semicolon-separated list of directories to probe for .clj and .clj.dll files to load.
