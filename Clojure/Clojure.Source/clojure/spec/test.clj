(defn instrument
  "Instruments the vars matched by ns-or-names, a symbol or a
collection of symbols. Instruments the current namespace if
ns-or-names not specified. Idempotent.

A var matches ns-or-names if ns-or-names includes either the var's
fully qualified name or the var's namespace.

If a var has an :args fn-spec, sets the var's root binding to a
fn that checks arg conformance (throwing an exception on failure)
before delegating to the original fn.

The opts map can be used to override registered specs, and/or to
replace fn implementations entirely. Opts for symbols not matched
by ns-or-names are ignored. This facilitates sharing a common
options map across many different calls to instrument.

The opts map may have the following keys:

  :spec     a map from var-name symbols to override specs
  :stub     a collection of var-name symbols to be replaced by stubs
  :gen      a map from spec names to generator overrides
  :replace  a map from var-name symbols to replacement fns

:spec overrides registered fn-specs with specs your provide. Use
:spec overrides to provide specs for libraries that do not have
them, or to constrain your own use of a fn to a subset of its
spec'ed contract.

:stub replaces a fn with a stub that checks :args, then uses the
:ret spec to generate a return value.

:gen overrides are used only for :stub generation.

:replace replaces a fn with a fn that checks args conformance, then
invokes the fn you provide, enabling arbitrary stubbing and mocking.

:spec can be used in combination with :stub or :replace.
